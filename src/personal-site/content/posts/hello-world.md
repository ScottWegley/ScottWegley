I wanted to create a website for a few different reasons.
- Replace a rather embarrassing years-old attempt at web design
- Host basic personal and contact information for anyone interested in connecting
- Store occasional blog posts on any personal projects I do

I love working on projects, but I don't have them to continually work on anything, meaning I end up setting down and picking projects back up fairly often.  Hopefully by writing blog posts about the things I work on, I will recall more about every project I pick back up.
