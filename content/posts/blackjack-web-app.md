It seems that being home for the holiday in a town with not much to do and limited in access to my normal technology is the perfect environment to encourage reminescing on and subsequently documenting my old projects.  The focus this time is my first [fully featured web app](https://scottwegley.github.io/BlackjackWebApp/game.html), which is just the game Blackjack.  The order I cover these older projects is not at all the order they were made in (in fact so far I think it is reverse order), but this one stands out in my memory.  This is one of the earliest (if not the earliest) fully independant project I assigned myself to develop my programming ability.

It's age relative to my ability means it has some major flaws, not the least of which is the user interface, but I can still look at this project very fondly.  This was my first time using TypeScript, which quickly became one of my favorite languages, and my first serious foray into Web Dev.  Beyond just interactive HTML files, this was my first time ever messing with session storage and building any sort of persistance into a project.  It was also my first time deploying anything through GitHub pages, which I continue to use to this day.  

The cardinal sin of this project is that every single bit of game logic is in one file, something I am kicking myself for as I write this since it makes tracking down my own work a nightmare.  There is no specific part of the code I want to callout; I would not call any of the code technically impressive.  The most important part of this code is not the design choices I made: it is the reasons I made them.  

I do not consider myself a creative person, which frankly is a disservice to myself.  The reason I feel this is that when I create, I usually do not create originality.  I like to replicate things that I already know and like, or combine things such that the product is new, but the pieces are not.  This site was the first time I had taken something I loved and made my version of it.  As terribly designed as it might be, it matters because that is still my favorite type of project to this day.  Every project on my todo list is my version of something familiar to me.  I think because my first language was Java, I have never fully shaken the OOP way of thinking.  My goal in the projects I love the most is always to come up with some sort of objective representation of or recreation of something I know.

Hopefully I get back to creating things like this in the future.
