I wanted to create a website for a few different reasons.
- Replace a rather embarrassing years-old attempt at web design
- Host basic personal and contact information for anyone interested in connecting
- Store occasional blog posts on any personal projects I do

I love working on projects, but I don't have time to continually work on anything, meaning I end up setting aside and picking projects back up fairly often.  Hopefully by writing blog posts about the things I work on, I will recall more about every project I pick back up.

This website is the first project to be getting a write-up.  My web dev experience is a little limited compared to other CS disciplines.  I have a rather large gaping hole where design intuition normally goes, which is why I'm using the lovely [Hugo PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).  I've also been more interested in the functional side of CS, so the little gimmicks of this site like the live age count on the home page are all me, while anything that looks nice is courtesy of either Hugo or PaperMod.

For those unaware, Hugo is a static site generator that I'm using for this site.  I considered a number of different stacks for this site but ultimately I wanted low friction set-up and maintenance.  

[React](https://react.dev/) was a buzzword in my brain, but feels daunting to learn entirely for personal use.  I can't justify the time investment when I don't see any professional opportunities in my future involving it.

I've used [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) before, and enjoyed it, but for that reason I chose not to use it again.  While I am prioritizing low friction, I also want to learn.  I was fairly set on a static site generator because I wanted something that GitHub pages would play nicely with out of the box; hosting things needs to wait while I finish my homelab.
