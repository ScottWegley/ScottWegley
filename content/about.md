Hi! I'm Scott Wegley, a {{< age >}} year old Cyber Security Engineer at PayPal based in the Phoenix area.

## Background

I'm passionate about technology, particularly cybersecurity, and I love working on miscellaneous tech projects. I started programming in 4th grade while competing in robotics tournaments through a non-profit called F.I.R.S.T. Since then, technology has captivated me. I continued to compete with F.I.R.S.T. through 12th grade, and I volunteer at tournaments and as a mentor to this day.

My original love for programming led me to pursue my higher education as fast as possible. I enrolled at my local community college at 14 to get ahead in my general education and start taking more programming classes.

Exploring the world of technology through academia led me to a long-term goal of Cyber Security. The field was a perfect fit, allowing me to combine my love of technology and problem-solving to make a fulfilling career.
