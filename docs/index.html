                        <p>I was a member of an F.L.L. team from 4th to 6th grade as part of my elementary school's after-school program.  F.L.L. was one of my first exposures to programming through their visual programming software and team-based work through the projects every F.L.L. team is required to present.  I decided very soon after my initial exposure that I would do something related to Computer Science for the rest of my life.</p>

                        <p>Right out of elementary school, I helped Pamela Richards, a woman who had mentored for a variety of F.I.R.S.T. programs, found an FTC Team which I joined, Team #11232.  This was my initial exposure to text-based programming and one of my formative leadership experiences.  For the first year, I maintained the position of programming lead, heading up a small team of programmers for the team.  For the second year, I returned to my programming lead position while picking up the role of team president.</p>

                        <p>F.R.C., the high school division of F.I.R.S.T., was a massive change from F.T.C.  Team #6657 ran like a business and was a valuable experience for learning how to be a productive team member and a better team leader.  Two of my four years were spent as one of the programming leads, dividing duties with one other lead.  While not a formal role, I also handled data aggregation and processing for a variety of different team projects including scouting opponents and allies for competitions, managing a self-designed attendance system, and tracking team member participation.  In my final year, I assumed the role of an accountant, keeping track of all funds, inventory, and purchases.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Starting in middle school, I began exploring the volunteering side of F.I.R.S.T.  As a fundraiser for my F.T.C. team, we put on an F.L.L. tournament which we all volunteered at.  In the four years this tournament ran, I fulfilled the catch-all role of the tournament organizer's assistant.  I was in charge of any managerial task or problem that the tournament organizer was too busy to handle.  I have volunteered in a variety of other tournaments and roles including a judge and a queuer.  Besides tournament volunteering, I have also mentored both F.T.C. and F.R.C. teams.  I spent two years as a junior mentor for Teams #11232 and #13926, and have spent one year as an F.R.C. mentor while in college for Team #3863. </p>
